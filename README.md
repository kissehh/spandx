DECO3850 SpandX project

SpandX is an interactive table with a spandex surface, which users can interact with to distort and manipulate a projected display of the solar system. Children are typically introduced to space and the universe in grade three; and through SpandX, primary school students will be able to learn the basics of physics and astronomy in the universe. SpandX encourages learning through play and exploration, aiming to provide teachers and students with a platform that allows for kinesthetic learning to take place.
