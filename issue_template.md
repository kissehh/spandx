### Titles
Issue Titles should include a clear task for a clear goal. Example:
> Show the depth of a push to visualise depth perception
Ideally, all we need to do is glance at the titles to understand what needs to be done.

### Labelling
There are a bunch of labels to choose from. Pick anything relevant. If there's a label that doesn't exist yet that you think should exist, let me know.

### Todo lists
These are really handy if you need them.
- [ ] task one
- [ ] task two
- [ ] task three


### "Ok I've written the issue...where the hell does this it go?"
Initially, they're all in the "New Issues" pipeline/column. If they're not yet associated with a milestone, chuck 'em in the product backlog. Otherwise, put it in the sprint backlog. If they're not a current focus, just put them in the backlog, we'll get to those issues later.
